# Contributing to CodeIgniter

CodeIgniter is a community driven project and accepts contributions of code and documentation from the community. These contributions are made in the form of Issues or [Pull Requests](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) on the [CodeIgniter repository](https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter) on GitHub.

Issues are a quick way to point out a bug. If you find a bug or documentation error in CodeIgniter then please check a few things first:

1. There is not already an open Issue
2. The issue has already been fixed (check the develop branch, or look for closed Issues)
3. Is it something really obvious that you can fix yourself?

Reporting issues is helpful but an even better approach is to send a Pull Request, which is done by "Forking" the main repository and committing to your own copy. This will require you to use the version control system called Git.

## Guidelines

Before we look into how, here are the guidelines. If your Pull Requests fail
to pass these guidelines it will be declined and you will need to re-submit
when youâ€™ve made the changes. This might sound a bit tough, but it is required
for us to maintain quality of the code-base.


1. [Set up Git](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git) (Windows, Mac & Linux)
2. Go to the [CodeIgniter repo](https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter)
3. [Fork it](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)
4. [Clone](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fetching-a-remote#clone) your forked CodeIgniter repo: git@github.com:<your-name>/CodeIgniter.git.
5. Checkout the "develop" branch. At this point you are ready to start making changes.
6. Fix existing bugs on the Issue tracker after taking a look to see nobody else is working on them.
7. [Commit](https://help.github.com/en/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository-using-the-command-line) the files
8. [Push](https://help.github.com/en/articles/pushing-to-a-remote) your develop branch to your fork
9. [Send a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)


If you are using command-line you can do the following:

1. `git remote add codeigniter git://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter.git`
2. `git pull codeigniter develop`
3. `git push origin develop`

Now your fork is up to date. This should be done regularly, or before you send a pull request at least.
